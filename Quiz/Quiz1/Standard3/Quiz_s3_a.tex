\section{Instructions}
 \begin{itemize}
	\item The solutions \textbf{should be typed}, using proper mathematical notation. We cannot accept hand-written solutions. \href{http://ece.uprm.edu/~caceros/latex/introduction.pdf}{Here's a short intro to \LaTeX.}
	\item You should submit your work through the \textbf{class Canvas page} only. Please submit one PDF file, compiled using this \LaTeX \ template.
	\item You may not need a full page for your solutions; pagebreaks are there to help Gradescope automatically find where each problem is. Even if you do not attempt every problem, please submit this document with no fewer pages than the blank template (or Gradescope has issues with it).

	\item You \textbf{may not collaborate with other students}. \textbf{Copying from any source is an Honor Code violation. Furthermore, all submissions must be in your own words and reflect your understanding of the material.} If there is any confusion about this policy, it is your responsibility to clarify before the due date. 

	\item Posting to \textbf{any} service including, but not limited to Chegg, Discord, Reddit, StackExchange, etc., for help on an assignment is a violation of the Honor Code.

	\item You \textbf{must} virtually sign the Honor Code (see Section \ref{HonorCode}). Failure to do so will result in your assignment not being graded.
\end{itemize}


\section{Honor Code (Make Sure to Virtually Sign)} \label{HonorCode}

\section{Standard 3- Exchange Arguments}

\subsection{Problem \ref{DFS1}}
\begin{required} \label{DFS1}
Suppose that there are $n$ homework assignments, where the $i$th homework assignment has difficulty $d_{i}>0$. All of the assignments are released on the first day of class, and you may turn in one assignment per week. If you turn in assignment $i$ on week $k$, then you receive $(n-k) e^{d_i}$ points. Do the following.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Consider a solution in which you turn in assignment $j$ before assignment $i$, even though $d_{i} > d_{j}$. Show that you can increase the number of points earned by turning in assignment $i$ before assignment $j$.

\begin{proof}
%Your answer here.
\begin{itemize}
\item From the formula of $ (n-k) e^{d_i}$, we can tell that n and $d_i$ is a constant number, which will not affect by turning in time. Thus, the solution to increase the number of points earned by turning in assignment i before assignment j is that turn in assignment i very before the assignment j so that minimize the number of k in the formula.
\item In the other words, the greedy solution is turn in the most difficult assignment at the first week, and turn in the easiest assignment at the last week of semester to maximize the number of points earned.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}


\vskip 50pt
\item Using part (a), describe a greedy algorithm to order the assignments in order to maximize the number of points earned. Pseudo-code is not required, but you should provide enough detail that a CSCI 2270 student could reasonably be expected to implement the solution from your description.

\begin{proof}[Answer]
%Your answer here
\begin{itemize}
\item The greedy algorithm can resort order of assignment in descending order, like from most difficult assignment to easiest assignment, and put them into a queue.
\item Because the most difficult assignment has the highest weight in the formula of earning points, and the greedy algorithm could minimize the number of week k to maximize the the number of points earned.
\item k is the number of iteration in the $for$ loop. n is the total number of homework assignments. $d_i$ is the difficulty of assignment i. Initialize a variable named $total score$ to 0.
\item At each iteration k, the first element will be polled from the queue, and calculate the point of this assignment eared. Then, add the point to the variable $total score$.
\item The algorithm terminates when the iteration over. And the result can be found on the variable $total score$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\end{enumerate}
\end{required}
